                <pre>My name is Nathan Frankenfield. I'm currently enrolled in an ASU coding bootcamp to learn how
                     to code like a professional! I graduated from Sabino High School in 2022 and am currently
                      working as a service coordinator! Once I graduate my dream would be to get a professional 
                      coding job and maybe as a hobby, game design! I'm excited to boost my career forward within 
                      this next year! I will be uploading any new projects I develop as the bootcamp goes on and 
                      I will update the "About Me" section as my life goes on!</pre>
